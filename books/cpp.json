        "description": "A detailed introduction to the C programming language for experienced programmers. The world runs on code written in the C programming language, yet most schools begin the curriculum with Python or Java. Effective C bridges this gap and brings C into the modern era--covering the modern C17 Standard as well as potential C2x features. With the aid of this instant classic, you'll soon be writing professional, portable, and secure C programs to power robust systems and solve real-world problems. Robert C. Seacord introduces C and the C Standard Library while addressing best practices, common errors, and open debates in the C community. Developed together with other C Standards committee experts, Effective C will teach you how to debug, test, and analyze C programs. You'll benefit from Seacord's concise explanations of C language constructs and behaviors, and from his 40 years of coding experience. You'll learn: • How to identify and handle undefined behavior in a C program • The range and representations of integers and floating-point values • How dynamic memory allocation works and how to use nonstandard functions • How to use character encodings and types • How to perform I/O with terminals and filesystems using C Standard streams and POSIX file descriptors • How to understand the C compiler's translation phases and the role of the preprocessor • How to test, debug, and analyze C programs Effective C will teach you how to write professional, secure, and portable C code that will stand the test of time and help strengthen the foundation of the computing world.",

This book will introduce you to computer programming and software development using C. If you're an experienced developer, this book will help you to become familiar with the C programming language. This C programming book takes you through basic programming concepts and shows you how to implement them in C. Throughout the book, you'll create and run programs that make use of one or more C concepts, such as program structure with functions, data types, and conditional statements. You'll also see how to use looping and iteration, arrays, pointers, and strings. As you make progress, you'll cover code documentation, testing and validation methods, basic input/output, and how to write complete programs in C. By the end of the book, you'll have developed basic programming skills in C, that you can apply to other programming languages and will develop a solid foundation for you to advance as a programmer. What you will learn Understand fundamental programming concepts and implement them in C Write working programs with an emphasis on code indentation and readability Break existing programs intentionally and learn how to debug code Adopt good coding practices and develop a clean coding style Explore general programming concepts that are applicable to more advanced projects Discover how you can use building blocks to make more complex and interesting programs Use C Standard Library functions and understand why doing this is desirable Who this book is for This book is written for two very diverse audiences. If you're an absolute beginner who only has basic familiarity with operating a computer, this book will help you learn the most fundamental concepts and practices you need to know to become a successful C programmer. If you're an experienced programmer, you'll find the full range of C syntax as well as common C idioms. You can skim through the explanations and focus primarily on the source code provided.",

The industry looks for developers with a rigorous, scientific understanding of the principles and practices. Extreme C will teach you to use C’s advanced low-level power to write effective, efficient systems. This intensive, practical guide will help you become an expert C programmer. Building on your existing C knowledge, you will master preprocessor directives, macros, conditional compilation, pointers, and much more. You will gain new insight into algorithm design, functions, and structures. You will discover how C helps you squeeze maximum performance out of critical, resource-constrained applications. C still plays a critical role in 21st-century programming, remaining the core language for precision engineering, aviations, space research, and more. This book shows how C works with Unix, how to implement OO principles in C, and fully covers multi-processing. In Extreme C, Amini encourages you to think, question, apply, and experiment for yourself. The book is essential for anybody who wants to take their C to the next level. What you will learn Build advanced C knowledge on strong foundations, rooted in first principles Understand memory structures and compilation pipeline and how they work, and how to make most out of them Apply object-oriented design principles to your procedural C code Write low-level code that’s close to the hardware and squeezes maximum performance out of a computer system Master concurrency, multithreading, multi-processing, and integration with other languages Unit Testing and debugging, build systems, and inter-process communication for C programming Who this book is for Extreme C is for C programmers who want to dig deep into the language and its capabilities. It will help you make the most of the low-level control C gives you.",

C isn’t just the foundation of modern programming languages, it is a modern language, ideal for writing efficient, state-of-the-art applications. Learn to dump old habits that made sense on mainframes, and pick up the tools you need to use this evolved and aggressively simple language. No matter what programming language you currently champion, you’ll agree that C rocks. Set up a C programming environment with shell facilities, makefiles, text editors, debuggers, and memory checkers Use Autotools, C’s de facto cross-platform package manager Learn which older C concepts should be downplayed or deprecated Explore problematic C concepts that are too useful to throw out Solve C’s string-building problems with C-standard and POSIX-standard functions Use modern syntactic features for functions that take structured inputs Build high-level object-based libraries and programs Apply existing C libraries for doing advanced math, talking to Internet servers, and running databases",

A CD-ROM with demos, code, compiler, executables, and MATLAB examples has been added to the book. Simplicity and an easy narration style are the hallmarks of the book, which have made its previous seven editions immensely successful. Today's C programmer (still the language of choice in science, engineering, game programming and for handheld devices) has to master the complexities of the language and contend with its usage in environments like Windows, Linux, and for the Internet. Let Us C, Eighth Edition covers these three aspects of C programming and doesn?t assume any programming background. It begins with the basics and steadily builds the pace, so the reader finds it easy to handle more complicated topics later. This popular author has crafted hundreds of excellent programming examples and exercises for every aspect of C programming.",

With this practical book, you’ll learn how pointers provide the mechanism to dynamically manipulate memory, enhance support for data structures, and enable access to hardware. Author Richard Reese shows you how to use pointers with arrays, strings, structures, and functions, using memory models throughout the book. Difficult to master, pointers provide C with much flexibility and power—yet few resources are dedicated to this data type. This comprehensive book has the information you need, whether you’re a beginner or an experienced C or C++ programmer or developer. Get an introduction to pointers, including the declaration of different pointer types Learn about dynamic memory allocation, de-allocation, and alternative memory management techniques Use techniques for passing or returning data to and from functions Understand the fundamental aspects of arrays as they relate to pointers Explore the basics of strings and how pointers are used to support them Examine why pointers can be the source of security problems, such as buffer overflow Learn several pointer techniques, such as the use of opaque pointers, bounded pointers and, the restrict keyword",

        "description": "The C programming language is a popular language in industries as well as academics. Since its invention and standardized as ANSI C, several other standards known as C99, C11, and C17 were published with new features in subsequent years. This book covers all the traits of ANSI C and includes new features present in other standards. The content of this book helps a beginner to learn the fundamental concept of the C language. The book contains a step-by-step explanation of every program that allows a learner to understand the syntax and builds a foundation to write similar programs. The explanation clarity, exercises, and illustrations present in this book make it a complete textbook in all aspects. Features: Other than ANSI C, the book explains the new C standards like C99, C11, and C17. Most basic and easy-to-follow programs are chosen to explain the concepts and their syntax. More emphasis is given to the topics like Functions, Pointers, and Structures. Recursion is emphasized with numerous programming examples and diagrams. A separate chapter on the command-line argument and preprocessors is included that concisely explains their usage. Several real-life figures are taken to explain the concepts of dynamic memory allocation, file handling, and the difference between structure and union. The book contains more than 260 illustrations, more than 200 programs, and exercises at the end of each chapter. This book serves as a textbook for UG/PG courses in science and engineering. The researcher, postgraduate engineers, and embedded software developers can also keep this book as reference material for their fundamental learning.",

        "description": "How can I improve my coding skills? This book has a unique approach, specially crafted for non-programmers/beginners. A sure way to become confident programmer is to master the technique of logic building skills. Solve pattern-based problems because it will improve the visualization of logic. After some level of practice, your mind will work like a mini-debugger where you could able to visualize the flow of data. If a problem asked in the interview or anywhere else, then we should able to get the logic correctly in a single chance, instead of guessing logic. This book is specially put in an easy way to be suitable for any age group and to fill the much-needed gap especially for:- Who is unaware of any approach to build programming logic? Who had a hard time learning to write a program? Who are teachers/trainers and looking for a reliable resource to create interest in the subject of programming for their students. Who had some experience in programming and not confident enough? Who carries the false notion that coding is only for super-smart people. Who are looking for a 1st solid move to become a self-taught programmer? Who had some experience in programming with pattern and looking for a STANDARD APPROACH to get the LOGIC RIGHT for any pattern. Who is a victim of discouragement comments, similar like the following? Actually, you aren't interested. You lack patience and determination.? Your IQ is well below average. Programming is not about memorizing programming logic or downloading standard college/university level algorithms by practice in our mind, rather we need to understand the approach to solve a problem. Many novice programmers and many frustrated programmers do ask similar kind of questions which are as follows; How to develop logic building skill? How to learn to code? How to improve program logic? The Right, Approach: So the rule of the thumb is, in order to learn programming language fast and properly, first learn to hack programming logic. So, initially building programming logic skills must be the first and foremost activity rather than concentrating more on the features/APIs of a programming language. This technical manual is totally dedicated to the beginner or intermediate students who are just tired of hitting hard on many places in order to become confident in programming. Additionally, if you are among those who got limited time to learn to program, this is the guide that can serve you well too. Learning with simple picture-based problems or pattern surely helps in improving coding skills. If we apply the wrong logical condition then the non-matching output will be generated. Learning in this way makes learning interesting and force us to put efforts & focused. So, in this way, it helps in logic building. In general, It suits to most of the beginners/non-programmers and programmer with weak coding skills. After mastering the skills from this book, a beginner can confidently solve logical problems like 2-3 years experienced programmer. This is just not a book but a sensible option to learn programming logic from the very minimal. Can you afford to miss the right way to learn programming skills?",

        "description": "Learning a language--any language--involves a process wherein you learn to rely less and less on instruction and more increasingly on the aspects of the language you've mastered. Whether you're learning French, Java, or C, at some point you'll set aside the tutorial and attempt to converse on your own. It's not necessary to know every subtle facet of French in order to speak it well, especially if there's a good dictionary available. Likewise, C programmers don't need to memorize every detail of C in order to write good programs. What they need instead is a reliable, comprehensive reference that they can keep nearby. C in a Nutshell is that reference. This long-awaited book is a complete reference to the C programming language and C runtime library. Its purpose is to serve as a convenient, reliable companion in your day-to-day work as a C programmer. C in a Nutshell covers virtually everything you need to program in C, describing all the elements of the language and illustrating their use with numerous examples. The book is divided into three distinct parts. The first part is a fast-paced description, reminiscent of the classic Kernighan & Ritchie text on which many C programmers cut their teeth. It focuses specifically on the C language and preprocessor directives, including extensions introduced to the ANSI standard in 1999. These topics and others are covered: Numeric constants Implicit and explicit type conversions Expressions and operators Functions Fixed-length and variable-length arrays Pointers Dynamic memory management Input and output The second part of the book is a comprehensive reference to the C runtime library; it includes an overview of the contents of the standard headers and a description of each standard library function. Part III provides the necessary knowledge of the C programmer's basic tools: the compiler, the make utility, and the debugger. The tools described here are those in the GNU software collection. C in a Nutshell is the perfect companion to K&R, and destined to be the most reached-for reference on your desk.",

        "description": "This book teaches computer programming to the complete beginner using the native C language. As such, it assumes you have no knowledge whatsoever about programming. The main goal of this book is to teach fundamental programming principles using C, one of the most widely used programming languages in the world today. We discuss only those features and statements in C that are necessary to achieve our goal. Once you learn the principles well, they can be applied to any language. If you are worried that you are not good at high-school mathematics, don’t be. It is a myth that you must be good at mathematics to learn programming. C is considered a ‘modern’ language even though its roots date back to the 1970s. Originally, C was designed for writing ‘systems’ programs—things like operating systems, editors, compilers, assemblers and input/output utility programs. But, today, C is used for writing all kinds of applications programs as well—word processing programs, spreadsheet programs, database management programs, accounting programs, games, robots, embedded systems/electronics (i.e., Arduino), educational software—the list is endless. Note: Appendices A-D are available as part of the free source code download at the Apress website.

Its ungainly appearance earned it the nickname \"the flying boxcar\" but the aircraft was the first to achieve practical end-loading and aerial delivery of cargoes. Its outsized capacity served the U.S. military's needs for more than ten years--civilian operators flew it in remote locations like Alaska and South America for a further three decades.

        "description": "Aristotle's theory of eternal continuous motion and his argument from everlasting change and motion to the existence of an unmoved primary cause of motion, provided in book VIII of his Physics, is one of the most influential and persistent doctrines of ancient Greek philosophy. Nevertheless, the exact wording of Aristotle's discourse is doubtful and contentious at many places. The present critical edition of Ishaq ibn Hunayn's Arabic translation (9th c.) is supposed to replace the faulty edition by A. Badawi and aims at contributing to the clarification of these textual difficulties by means of a detailed collation of the Arabic text with the most important Greek manuscripts, supported by comprehensive Greek and Arabic glossaries.",
