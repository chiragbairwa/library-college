My attempt is to make DBMS very simple so that a student feels as if the teacher is sitting behind him and guiding him. This text is bolstered with many examples and Case Studies. In this book, the experiments are also included which are to be performed in DBMS lab. Every effort has been made to alleviate the treatment of the book for easy flow of understanding of the students as well as the professors alike. This textbook of DBMS for all graduate and post-graduate programmes of Delhi University, GGSIPU, Rajiv Gandhi Technical University, UPTU, WBTU, BPUT, PTU and so on. The salient features of this book are: - 1. Multiple Choice Questions 2. Conceptual Short Questions 3. Important Points are highlighted / Bold faced. 4. Very lucid and simplified approach 5.Bolstered with numerous examples and CASE Studies 6. Experiments based on SQL incorporated. 7. DBMS Projects added Question Papers of various universities are also included.",

        "description": "A database management system (DBMS) is a collection of programs that enable users to create and maintain a database; it also consists of a collection of interrelated data and a set of programs to access that data. Hence, a DBMS is a general-purpose software system that facilitates the processes of defining, constructing, and manipulating databases for various applications. The primary goal of a DBMS is to provide an environment that is both convenient and efficient to use in retrieving and storing database information. It is an interface between the user of application programs, on the one hand, and the database, on the other. The objective of Database Management System: An Evolutionary Approach, is to enable the learner to grasp a basic understanding of a DBMS, its need, and its terminologies discern the difference between the traditional file-based systems and a DBMS code while learning to grasp theory in a practical way study provided examples and case studies for better comprehension This book is intended to give under- and postgraduate students a fundamental background in DBMSs. The book follows an evolutionary learning approach that emphasizes the basic concepts and builds a strong foundation to learn more advanced topics including normalizations, normal forms, PL/SQL, transactions, concurrency control, etc. This book also gives detailed knowledge with a focus on entity-relationship (ER) diagrams and their reductions into tables, with sufficient SQL codes for a more practical understanding.",

An effort has been made to familiarize the readers with the concepts of database normalization, concurrency control, deadlock handling and recovery etc., which are extremely vital for a clear understanding of DBMS. To familiarize the readers with the equivalence amongst Relational Algebra, Tuple Relational Calculus, and SQL, a large number of equivalent queries have been provided. The concepts of normalization have been elaborated very systematically by fully covering the underlying concepts of functional dependencies, multi-valued dependencies, join dependencies, loss-less-join decomposition, dependency-preserving decomposition etc. It is hoped that with the help of the information provided in the text, a reader will be able to design a flawless database. Also, the concepts of serializabilty, concurrency control, deadlock handling and log-based recovery have been covered in full detail. An overview has also been provided of the issues related to distributed-databases.",

        "description": "The contents of this second edition have been appropriately enhanced to serve the growing needs of the students pursuing undergraduate engineering courses in Computer Science, Information Technology, as well as postgraduate programmes in Computer Applications (MCA), MSc (IT) and MSc (Computer Science). The book covers the fundamental and theoretical concepts in an elaborate manner using SQL of leading RDBMS—Oracle, MS SQL Server and Sybase. This book is recommended in Guwahati University, Assam. Realizing the importance of RDBMS in all types of architectures and applications, both traditional and modern topics are included for the benefit of IT-savvy readers. A strong understanding of the relational database design is provided in chapters on Entity-Relationship, Relational, Hierarchical and Network Data Models, Normalization, Relational Algebra and Relational Calculus. The architecture of the legacy relational database R system, the hierarchical database IMS of IBM and the network data model DBTG are also given due importance to bring completeness and to show thematic interrelationships among them. Several chapters have been devoted to the latest database features and technologies such as Data Partitioning, Data Mirroring, Replication, High Availability, Security and Auditing. The architecture of Oracle, SQL of Oracle known as PL/SQL, SQL of both Sybase and MS SQL Server known as T-SQL have been covered. KEY FEATURES : Gives wide coverage to topics of network, hierarchical and relational data models of both traditional and generic modern databases. Discusses the concepts and methods of Data Partitioning, Data Mirroring and Replication required to build the centralized architecture of very large databases. Provides several examples, listings, exercises and solutions to selected exercises to stimulate and accelerate the learning process of the readers. Covers the concept of database mirroring and log shipping to demonstrate how to build disaster recovery solution through the use of database technology. Contents: Preface 1. Introduction 2. The Entity-Relationship Model 3. Data Models 4. Storage Structure 5. Relational Data Structure 6. Architecture of System R and Oracle 7. Normalization 8. Structured Query Language 9.

DESCRIPTION The knowledge of Database Management Systems (DBMS) has become a de facto necessity for every business user. Understanding various databases and how it becomes an integral part of any application has been a popular curriculum for undergraduates. In this book, you will learn about database design and how to build one. It has six chapters meant to bridge the gap between theory and legit implementation. Concepts and architecture, Entity-relation model, Relational model, Structured Query Language, Relational database design, and transaction management are covered in the book. The ER and relational models are demonstrated using a database system from an engineering college and implemented using the MySQL standard. The final chapter explains transaction management, concurrency, and recovery methods. The final chapter explains transaction management, concurrency, and recovery methods. With a straightforward language and a student-centered approach, this book provides hands-on experience with MySQL implementation. It will be beneficial as a textbook for undergraduate students, and database specialists in their professional capacity may also use it. WHAT YOU WILL LEARN ● Acquire a firm grasp of the principles of data and database management systems. ● Outlines the whole development and implementation process for databases. ● Learn how to follow step-by-step normalization rules and keep your data clean. ● MySQL operations such as DDL, DML, DCL, TCL, and embedded queries are performed. ● Develop an understanding of how the transaction management and recovery system operates. WHO THIS BOOK IS FOR This book is ideal for anyone who is interested in learning more about Database Management Systems, whether they are undergraduate students, new database developers, or with some expertise. Programming foundations, file system ideas, and discrete structure concepts are recommended but not required. TABLE OF CONTENTS 1. Database System Concepts and Architecture 2. The Entity-Relationship Model 3. Relational Model and Relational Algebra 4. Structured Query Language and Indexing 5. Relational Database Design 6.
