        "description": "JavaScript is at the heart of almost every modern Web application, whether it's Google Apps, Twitter, or the newest browser-based game. Though it's simple for beginners to pick up and play with, JavaScript is not a toy—it's a flexible and complex language that can be used to build full-scale applications. Eloquent JavaScript dives into this flourishing language and teaches you to write code that's beautiful and effective. By immersing you in example code and encouraging experimentation right from the start, the author quickly gives you the tools you need to build your own programs. As you follow along with examples like an artificial life simulation and a version of the classic game Sokoban, you'll learn to: –Understand the essential elements of programming: syntax, control, and data –Use object-oriented and functional programming techniques to organize and clarify your programs –Script the browser and make basic Web applications –Work with tools like regular expressions and XMLHttpRequest objects And since programming is an art that's best learned by doing, all example code is available online in an interactive sandbox for you to experiment with. With Eloquent JavaScript as your guide, you can tweak, expand, and modify the author's code, or throw it away and build your own creations from scratch. Before you know it, you'll be fluent in the language of the Web.",

        "description": "Completely revised and updated, this best-selling introduction to programming in JavaScript focuses on writing real applications. JavaScript lies at the heart of almost every modern web application, from social apps like Twitter to browser-based game frameworks like Phaser and Babylon. Though simple for beginners to pick up and play with, JavaScript is a flexible, complex language that you can use to build full-scale applications. This much anticipated and thoroughly revised third edition of Eloquent JavaScript dives deep into the JavaScript language to show you how to write beautiful, effective code. It has been updated to reflect the current state of Java¬Script and web browsers and includes brand-new material on features like class notation, arrow functions, iterators, async functions, template strings, and block scope. A host of new exercises have also been added to test your skills and keep you on track. As with previous editions, Haverbeke continues to teach through extensive examples and immerses you in code from the start, while exercises and full-chapter projects give you hands-on experience with writing your own programs. You start by learning the basic structure of the JavaScript language as well as control structures, functions, and data structures to help you write basic programs. Then you'll learn about error handling and bug fixing, modularity, and asynchronous programming before moving on to web browsers and how JavaScript is used to program them. As you build projects such as an artificial life simulation, a simple programming language, and a paint program, you'll learn how to: - Understand the essential elements of programming, including syntax, control, and data - Organize and clarify your code with object-oriented and functional programming techniques - Script the browser and make basic web applications - Use the DOM effectively to interact with browsers - Harness Node.js to build servers and utilities Isn't it time you became fluent in the language of the Web? * All source code is available online in an inter¬active sandbox, where you can edit the code, run it, and see its output instantly.",

        "description": "Update your skill set for ES 6 and 7 with the ultimate JavaScript guide for pros Professional JavaScript for Web Developers is the essential guide to next-level JavaScript development. Written for intermediate-to-advanced programmers, this book jumps right into the technical details to help you clean up your code and become a more sophisticated JavaScript developer. From JavaScript-specific object-oriented programming and inheritance, to combining JavaScript with HTML and other markup languages, expert instruction walks you through the fundamentals and beyond. This new fourth edition has been updated to cover ECMAScript 6 and 7 (also known as ES2015 and ES2016) and the major re-imagination and departure from ES 5.1; new frameworks and libraries, new techniques, new testing tools, and more are explained in detail for the professional developer, with a practical focus that helps you put your new skills to work on real-world projects. The latest—and most dramatic—ES release is already being incorporated into JavaScript engines in major browsers; this, coupled with the rise in mobile web traffic increasing demand for responsive, dynamic web design, means that all web developers need to update their skills—and this book is your ideal resource for quick, relevant guidance.

        "description": "Most programming languages contain good and bad parts, but JavaScript has more than its share of the bad, having been developed and released in a hurry before it could be refined. This authoritative book scrapes away these bad features to reveal a subset of JavaScript that's more reliable, readable, and maintainable than the language as a whole—a subset you can use to create truly extensible and efficient code. Considered the JavaScript expert by many people in the development community, author Douglas Crockford identifies the abundance of good ideas that make JavaScript an outstanding object-oriented programming language-ideas such as functions, loose typing, dynamic objects, and an expressive object literal notation. Unfortunately, these good ideas are mixed in with bad and downright awful ideas, like a programming model based on global variables. When Java applets failed, JavaScript became the language of the Web by default, making its popularity almost completely independent of its qualities as a programming language. In JavaScript: The Good Parts, Crockford finally digs through the steaming pile of good intentions and blunders to give you a detailed look at all the genuinely elegant parts of JavaScript, including: Syntax Objects Functions Inheritance Arrays Regular expressions Methods Style Beautiful features The real beauty? As you move ahead with the subset of JavaScript that this book presents, you'll also sidestep the need to unlearn all the bad parts. Of course, if you want to find out more about the bad parts and how to use them badly, simply consult any other JavaScript book. With JavaScript: The Good Parts, you'll discover a beautiful, elegant, lightweight and highly expressive language that lets you create effective code, whether you're managing object libraries or just trying to get Ajax to run fast. If you develop sites or applications for the Web, this book is an absolute must.",

By applying the design patterns outlined in this practical book, experienced JavaScript developers will learn how to write flexible and resilient code that’s easier—yes, easier—to work with as your code base grows. JavaScript may be the most essential web programming language, but in the real world, JavaScript applications often break when you make changes. With this book, author Eric Elliott shows you how to add client- and server-side features to a large JavaScript application without negatively affecting the rest of your code. Examine the anatomy of a large-scale JavaScript application Build modern web apps with the capabilities of desktop applications Learn best practices for code organization, modularity, and reuse Separate your application into different layers of responsibility Build efficient, self-describing hypermedia APIs with Node.js Test, integrate, and deploy software updates in rapid cycles Control resource access with user authentication and authorization Expand your application’s reach through internationalization",

If you are an emerging web developer with experience in building static web pages using HTML and CSS, this book will teach you to add JavaScript elements to make your website interactive and dynamic. What You Will Learn A strong understanding of web application development with JavaScript and ES6. A firm foundation on which to master other JavaScript frameworks and libraries. Write maintainable and scalable code by organizing functions into modules. Importance of tools such as Node, NPM, Babel, and Webpack in Front-end development. Work with real-time data such as incoming video streams, texts, and so on Integrate React with JavaScript to build large-scale applications. Utilize Redux to manage data across React components and greatly speed up the development process In Detail JavaScript is the programming language that all web developers need to learn. The first item on our JavaScript to-do list is building g a To-do list app, which you'll have done by the end of the first chapter. You'll explore DOM manipulation with JavaScript and work with event listeners. You'll work with images and text to build a Meme creator. You will also learn about ES (ECMAScript) classes, and will be introduced to layouts using the CSS3 Flexbox. You'll also develop a responsive Event Registration form that allows users to register for your upcoming event and use charts and graphics to display registration data. You will then build a weather application, which will show you different ways perform AJAX requests and work with dynamic, external data. WebRTC enables real-time communication in a web browser; you'll learn how to use it when you build a real-time video-call and chat application later in the book. Towards the end of the book, you will meet React, Facebook's JavaScript library for building user interfaces. You'll throw together a blog with React, and get a feel for why this kind of JavaScript framework is used to build large-scale applications. To make your blog more maintainable and scalable, you'll use Redux to manage data across React components. Style and approach This project-based guide will teach you all the facets of JavaScript through real-world app examples.",

        "description": "Completely revised and updated, this best-selling introduction to programming in JavaScript focuses on writing real applications. JavaScript lies at the heart of almost every modern web application, from social apps like Twitter to browser-based game frameworks like Phaser and Babylon. Though simple for beginners to pick up and play with, JavaScript is a flexible, complex language that you can use to build full-scale applications. This much anticipated and thoroughly revised third edition of Eloquent JavaScript dives deep into the JavaScript language to show you how to write beautiful, effective code. It has been updated to reflect the current state of Java¬Script and web browsers and includes brand-new material on features like class notation, arrow functions, iterators, async functions, template strings, and block scope. A host of new exercises have also been added to test your skills and keep you on track. As with previous editions, Haverbeke continues to teach through extensive examples and immerses you in code from the start, while exercises and full-chapter projects give you hands-on experience with writing your own programs. You start by learning the basic structure of the JavaScript language as well as control structures, functions, and data structures to help you write basic programs. Then you'll learn about error handling and bug fixing, modularity, and asynchronous programming before moving on to web browsers and how JavaScript is used to program them. As you build projects such as an artificial life simulation, a simple programming language, and a paint program, you'll learn how to: - Understand the essential elements of programming, including syntax, control, and data - Organize and clarify your code with object-oriented and functional programming techniques - Script the browser and make basic web applications - Use the DOM effectively to interact with browsers - Harness Node.js to build servers and utilities Isn't it time you became fluent in the language of the Web? * All source code is available online in an inter¬active sandbox, where you can edit the code, run it, and see its output instantly.",

        "description": "Summary JavaScript Application Design: A Build First Approach introduces JavaScript developers to techniques that will improve the quality of their software as well as their web development workflow. You'll begin by learning how to establish build processes that are appropriate for JavaScript-driven development. Then, you'll walk through best practices for productive day-to-day development, like running tasks when your code changes, deploying applications with a single command, and monitoring the state of your application once it's in production. Purchase of the print book includes a free eBook in PDF, Kindle, and ePub formats from Manning Publications. About the Book The fate of most applications is often sealed before a single line of code has been written. How is that possible? Simply, bad design assures bad results. Good design and effective processes are the foundation on which maintainable applications are built, scaled, and improved. For JavaScript developers, this means discovering the tooling, modern libraries, and architectural patterns that enable those improvements. JavaScript Application Design: A Build First Approach introduces techniques to improve software quality and development workflow. You'll begin by learning how to establish processes designed to optimize the quality of your work. You'll execute tasks whenever your code changes, run tests on every commit, and deploy in an automated fashion. Then you'll focus on designing modular components and composing them together to build robust applications. This book assumes readers understand the basics of JavaScript. What's Inside Automated development, testing, and deployment processes JavaScript fundamentals and modularity best practices Modular, maintainable, and well-tested applications Master asynchronous flows, embrace MVC, and design a REST API About the Author Nicolas Bevacqua is a freelance developer with a focus on modular JavaScript, build processes, and sharp design. He maintains a blog at ponyfoo.com. Table of Contents PART 1 BUILD PROCESSES Introduction to Build First Composing build tasks and flows Mastering environments and the development workflow Release, deployment, and monitoring PART 2 MANAGING COMPLEXITY Embracing modularity and dependency management Understanding asynchronous flow control methods in JavaScript Leveraging the Model-View-Controller Testing JavaScript components REST API design and layered service architectures",
